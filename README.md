# Installing QuickPurple
  * Get sources
  * Ensure dependencies. You need Pidgin and [Gtk Hotkey](https://launchpad.net/gtkhotkey) installed.
  * Build QuickPurple: make
  * Install it (as root): make install

# Launching QuickPurple
Press Ctrl+Alt+I to pop up its window and start typing a buddy name or status you want to switch to. Use arrows or Ctrl+j and Ctrl+k to move up and down. Press enter to activate the status or open a conversation. Also the same way you may open some Pidgin dialogs.

# QuickPurple on Windows
Unfortunately, currently I have no Windows box to try to build it on Windows, so everybody who would like to help is welcome!
